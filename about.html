            <p id="para">Founded in 2010, our organization began as a small grassroots movement aimed at cleaning up local parks and promoting recycling in our community. <br><br> With a handful of dedicated volunteers, we organized monthly clean-up events and educational workshops.
            In 2012, we expanded our efforts to include larger environmental campaigns, partnering with local businesses and schools to promote sustainable practices. <br><br> This period marked significant growth, with our volunteer base increasing and our initiatives gaining more recognition.
            By 2015, we had established ourselves as a prominent voice in the environmental community. <br><br>Our projects grew to include wildlife conservation efforts, advocacy for renewable energy, and community gardening programs. We also launched an online platform to share resources, news, and tips on sustainable living.
            <br><br>Today, we continue to build on our past successes, reaching a broader audience and making a greater impact. Our history is a testament to the power of community action and the importance of environmental stewardship. <br><br>We are proud of our journey and remain committed to our mission of promoting a sustainable future for all.</p>
